<h1 className="!mb-0">Signal Kinetics</h1>

**Decentralised science | [@signal-k](https://github.com/signal-k/)**

Signal Kinetics is building protocols that allow us to get rewarded for participating in both the online and "real" worlds. Playing a browser-based game or scrolling through social media won't be a waste of time if it can be gamified and educational. Thousands of companies have tried to gamify education, but they mostly fail because they come from an education background and don't understand digital natives. At Signal Kinetics, we build our platform tech-first, so that it's always engaging and attractive to the user

In short: We're building the future of digital and analogue communications and discovery
